// Package ed25519 implements the Ed25519 signature algorithm. See

//
// These functions are also compatible with the “Ed25519” function defined in
// RFC 8032. However, unlike RFC 8032's formulation, this package's private key
// representation includes a public key suffix to make multiple signing
// operations with the same key more efficient.
